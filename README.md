# MultiXIVLauncher

A lightweight multi-instance launcher for Final Fantasy XIV — designed especially for **bards** and multi-character users.  
It lets you launch several XIVLauncher sessions without Windows accounts, using isolated environments per character.

## 🧰 How to Create Presets

1. Create a simple character in the launcher.  
2. Launch it once.  
3. Configure everything — repos, plugins, Dalamud settings, etc.  
4. Exit the game.  
5. Navigate to the **Characters** directory, then copy the content of your character folder into **Presets/Your_Preset**.  
   - For example: if it’s your first character, its folder will be `Character_1`.  
6. When creating a new character in the launcher, select that preset — it will copy all the configuration automatically.

## 💡 Notes

- You can organize characters into **groups** and launch several at once.  
- Presets let you instantly clone a setup (plugins, Dalamud configs, system settings, etc.).  
- RAM usage is significantly reduced since no Windows user accounts are used.
